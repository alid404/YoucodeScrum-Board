# Scrum Board Tasks Manager 

**Scrum Board** is an interactive, user-friendly Scrum Board task management application built with JavaScript Vanilla, HTML5, and CSS3 Bootstrap . Designed for efficient task management in a Scrum framework, the application provides a dynamic and accessible board for tracking the stages of tasks across "To Do," "Doing," and "Done" columns, ensuring data persistence and an optimized user experience.

## Project Overview ðŸ“‹


## Key Features âœ¨

### Task Management 

* **CRUD Functionalities:** Add, edit, and delete tasks with form validation to maintain data integrity.
* **Field Validation:** Ensures all required fields are filled correctly before adding or updating a task.
* **Interactive Modal Window:** A modal for creating and editing tasks with validation for smooth user interaction.

### Data Persistence 

* **LocalStorage Integration:** Automatically saves tasks and board state, allowing data to persist across sessions.

### Advanced Interactions  

* **Drag and Drop (Optional):** Move tasks between columns ("To Do," "Doing," "Done") for easy task progress tracking.
* **Animations:** Light animations enhance the experience when adding, moving, and removing tasks.

## Technologies Used 

* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** All dynamic functionalities are built without dependencies on frameworks to optimize performance.
* **HTML5/CSS3:** Structuring and styling of the dashboard are responsive and modern.


## User Stories 

1. **User: I can add a new task to the "To Do" column by filling in the required fields in the modal.
2. **User: I can move tasks between columns by dragging and dropping to visually track progress.
3. **User: I want my tasks and their statuses to be saved automatically to LocalStorage for retrieval in future sessions.
4. **Developer: Implement field validation to ensure only complete tasks are added or edited.
